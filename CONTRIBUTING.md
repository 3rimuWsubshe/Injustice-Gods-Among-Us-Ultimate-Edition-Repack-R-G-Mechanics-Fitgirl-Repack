### Opening new Issues

To open new issue for Nelua (bug or enhancement), just try to follow these rules:

- If you need support, have questions, ideas to discuss you should use the [Nelua Discussions](https://github.com/edubart/nelua-lang/discussions) forum or the [Nelua Discord server](https://discord.gg/7aaGeG7) instead of opening a new issue.
- Make sure you test the issue on the latest master branch.
- Make sure the issue has not already been reported before by searching on GitHub under issues or planned in the roadmap.
- Make sure you are not misusing Nelua.
- Be sure to include a title, a clear description, expected behavior, relevant information, and a code sample demonstrating the unexpected behavior.

### Sending a Pull Request

- Make sure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Don't send big pull requests (lots of changes), they are difficult to review. It's better to send small pull requests, one at a time.
- When fixing a bug or adding a feature add tests related to your changes to assure the changes will always work as intended in the future and also to cover new lines added.
- Verify that changes don't break the tests.
